1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?

5-6

2. Describe the features you have implemented.

All the required features + basic styling. 

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.

Difficulties were essentially figuring out how to check only one box in React, this was difficult but just had to deal with adding another layer of state. 

Again, the current code uploaded is very rudimentary, there are many enhancements that could be made such as cleaning up the number of extraneous functions / syntax. 


4. How much time do you think you can spend each week working for theDP Web Department?

I can work up to 4-5 hours per week. 

5. (Optional) If there is anything you want to tell us, go ahead :)

Excited at possibility of joining the team!
